# Finished Games Viewer

## Introduction

Javascript-based viewer for my [Finished Games](https://github.com/Kartones/finished-games) project. 

## Instructions

It uses JSON data exported via the `manage.py export_user_catalog <a-username>` command inside **Finished Games**. After exporting the data, place it inside the `data` subfolder.

Then, use whatever http server you fancy to run it. For development I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
